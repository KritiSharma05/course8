    <h2>Brooklyn Bridge</h2>
     <p>The Brooklyn Bridge is a hybrid cable-stayed/suspension bridge in New York City, spanning the East River between the 
         boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Opened on May 24, 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was the first fixed crossing of the 
         East River. It was also the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time of its opening, with a main span of 
         1,595.5 feet (486.3 m) and a deck 127 ft (38.7 m) above mean high water. The span was originally called the New York 
         and Brooklyn Bridge or the East River Bridge but was officially renamed the Brooklyn Bridge in 19150.

          <h2>Hoover Dam</h2>
          <p>Hoover Dam is a concrete arch-gravity dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River, on the border between 
            the U.S. states of Nevada and Arizona. It was constructed between 1931 and 1936 during the Great Depression 
            and was dedicated on September 30, 1935, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Its construction was the result 
            of a massive effort involving thousands of workers, and cost over one hundred lives.
